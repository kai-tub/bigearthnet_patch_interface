# Installation

The package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bigearthnet-patch-interface/) and on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/bigearthnet-patch-interface).
If you are using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), it is highly recommended to install the package via those package managers.
Otherwise they have no way of knowing how to resolve future dependency conflicts.

To install the package run the following code:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} mamba
```
mamba install bigearthnet-patch-interface
```
:::

:::{tab-item} conda
```
conda install bigearthnet-patch-interface
```
:::

:::{tab-item} pip
```bash
pip install bigearthnet_patch_interface
```
:::

:::{note}
The name of the package contains under-scores (`_`) which are replaced with dashes (`-`) on conda-forge!
